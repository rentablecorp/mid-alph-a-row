## The goal:

The goal of this project is to create an application that takes in user typed input, and uses good UX (up to you) to display the longest "even" or "odd" streak of letters.
Evenness for the letters alternates with a = even, b = odd, c = even, d = odd etc.

A few gotchas:

- Whitespace neither counts for a streak, nor breaks a streak
- Non-alphabetic characters including numbers break a streak
- Capitalization does not matter

Underneath the displayed string, please put the total streak count

Here are some examples of what a finished product could look like. Feel free to make it your own:

Please feel free to use any front end and backend frameworks you would like, but make sure to include a readme with instructions on how to get your app up and running locally.

The front-end should be responsible for displaying the content and functionality, while the backend should do the actual calculations.
